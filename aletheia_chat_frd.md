Feature Requirements Document (FRD): Aletheia Chat Interface

Version: 1.0 → 2.0 Roadmap

Author: [Athena Systems Architecture]

Date: 28 Oct 2025

Status: Draft for Development

⸻

1. Overview

Objective:
Develop a two-phase conversational interface for Aletheia, enabling her to serve as an interactive ideation and reflection agent.
	•	v1: Text-only interaction for context-driven dialogue, summarization, and insight generation.
	•	v2: Multimodal expansion with image comprehension, visual tagging, and cross-modal reasoning.

Aletheia acts as the active cognitive layer, while Mnemosyne remains the semantic archive.

2. Version 1.0 – Text-Only Intelligence Layer

Scope

Enable conversational ideation using natural language only.
No visual parsing, embedding, or multimodal reasoning yet.

Core Features

Component	Function	Status
Text Chat UI / API	WebSocket or REST interface for natural-language dialogue	MVP
Session Context Engine	Maintains 30-day conversation memory and topic weights	Required
Topic-Aware Retrieval	Pulls historical digests from Mnemosyne by topic + date range	Required
Summary Generation	Produces textual digests, insights, and idea lists	Required
Daily Refresh Loop	Background sync with Mnemosyne	Required
Feedback Tags	Accept / reject / flag-for-later on each idea	Required
Reflection Log	Text summary of each completed session	Optional (v1.1)

Technical Outline

User → Chat Interface → Aletheia Core
     ↳ Short-Term Cache (30 days)
     ↳ Mid-Term Summary (90 days)
     ↳ Mnemosyne API (pull/push)

KPIs
	•	Avg. response latency < 500 ms
	•	Context coherence ≥ 95 % over 15-turn conversation
	•	Refresh completion < 2 min
	•	Offline resilience 72 h

Deliverables
	•	CLI / Web chat front end
	•	Context management API
	•	Logging + telemetry dashboard

3. Version 2.0 – Multimodal Expansion

Goal

Integrate image comprehension and visual ideation without breaking text-based context continuity.

New Capabilities

Module	Description
Image Ingestion Pipeline	Accepts uploaded or linked images for analysis / inspiration. Converts to embeddings tied to topics.
Visual Context Fusion	Merges visual embeddings with textual context in shared vector space.
Image Summarization	Generates text summaries of visuals (mood, composition, concept tags).
Visual Prompting	User can ask Aletheia to describe, compare, or extract ideas from an image.
Cross-Modal Recall	Retrieve relevant past visuals when text queries overlap in concept space.

Example Queries

"Show me image references that match last week's 'liquidity flows' metaphor."
"Summarise this chart and tell me what narrative fits it."

Storage Additions (Mnemosyne v2)
	•	Image Embeddings Table — CLIP-style vector store
	•	Cross-reference Index — link visual IDs ↔ text topic IDs
	•	Preview Cache — low-res thumbnails for recall UI

Milestones

2.1	Image ingestion & tagging	Month 1
2.2	Visual–text embedding fusion	Month 2
2.3	Cross-modal recall & dialogue	Month 3
2.4	UI upgrade (image preview pane)	Month 4

5. Architecture Integration Summary

Layer	Component	Owner	Description
Interface Layer	Chat UI / API	Aletheia	Text or multimodal interface for user dialogue
Cognitive Layer	Context Engine, Summary Engine	Aletheia	Manages reasoning and reflection
Memory Layer	Long-term Archive	Mnemosyne	Stores summaries, embeddings, and cross-modal memory
Refresh Daemon	Sync Process	Aletheia → Mnemosyne	Performs daily summarization + decay

6. Implementation Notes
	•	Build v1 in pure text first; ensure conversation stability before adding vision.
	•	v2 should reuse Aletheia’s same context engine, only extending vector space to multimodal embeddings.
	•	Ensure backward compatibility: text-only users
